Description
-----------
Compact Admin simply makes the posts and pages lists in the admin pages more
compact. Instead of taking up two lines of text, plus excessive margins, only
one line is used per post/page. It also replaces the cluttery en dashes with
whitespace.

Companct Admin is released as open source and can be used, modified and
redistributed in any way possible.


Installation
------------
1. Put the __compact-admin__ directory in your wordpress plugins directory, located at __<wordpress>/wp-content/plugins.
2. Activate Compact Admin in the Plugins section of the Wordpress admin.
