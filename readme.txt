Compact Admin simply makes the posts and pages lists in the admin pages more
compact. 

== Description ==
Compact Admin simply makes the posts and pages lists in the admin pages more
compact. Instead of taking up two lines of text, plus excessive margins, only
one line is used per post/page. It also replaces the cluttery en dashes with
whitespace.
